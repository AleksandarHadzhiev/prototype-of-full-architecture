## Forward Proxy

This proxy, will be the endpoint which the browser (end-user) will access, instead of the web server itself. The proxy will redirect the calls to the web-server, adding an additional layer of security, by hiding the real endpoint of the web server. It will also provide cache, and a load balancer.
